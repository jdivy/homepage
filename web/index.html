        <h2>What brings home the bacon?</h2>

        <p class="lead">Jack is a programmer with many talents. He has a B.S. in
            Computer Science from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_and_Lee_University">Washington
                and Lee University</a> and is currently pursuing a M.S. in Computer Science
            from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University">Johns Hopkins University</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 pull-left">
        <h4>What languages does he speak?</h4>

        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> is definitely his bread and
            butter at
            the moment, but Jack is very familiar with <a
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovy_(programming_language)">Groovy</a> (makes sense) and
            dabbles in <a
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">JavaScript</a> either as part of Node.js or with the help of jQuery. He's also been
            known to throw together a website or two whether it be something simple (what you are looking at) or
            something with a little more meat like a <a href="http://grails.org/">Grails</a> web application, so he has good command of html and css.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 pull-left">
        <h4>What tools does he use?</h4>

        <p>Jack currently uses <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> for SCM and <a
                href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> for an IDE, but he
            has come from a long history of Eclipse and Subversion. His build tool of choice is <a
                    href="http://www.gradle.org/">Gradle</a>, also a
            switch from a history of using Maven.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 pull-left">
        <h4>Anything else?</h4>

        <p>He is knowledgeable on many aspects of the software development lifecycle, with a particular focus on
            Agile practices. Somewhat related, he has much experience with set-up, maintenance, and use of automated
            build tools such as Hudson, <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>, and <a
                    href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo">Atlassian Bamboo</a>, as well as the entire <a
                    href="https://www.atlassian.com/software">Atlassian suite</a> of
            development tools.</p>

        <h2>What would make Jack sell his kidney on the black market?</h2>

        <p class="lead">Assuming he knew how to access "the black market", quite a bit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 pull-left">
        <h4>His wife needs a kidney.</h4>

        <p>Well, in this case he would <em>give</em> his kidney away for free and avoid the black market altogether.
            Needless to say, Jack loves his wife. Whether or not his kidney would fit is an entirely different
            question.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 pull-left">
        <h4>He could work for himself.</h4>

        <p>A bit of a <a id="worktip">pipe dream</a>, Jack has always thought it would be nice to work for himself.
            While he has plenty
            of ideas, making the jump to a world without a regular paycheck is downright...well...scary.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 pull-left">
        <h4><a href="https://tonx.org/">Tonx</a> coffee wants to expand.</h4>

        <p>Scenario. Business is booming and shipping all the way across the country from California is difficult.
            Opening a new location in <a id="memtip">Memphis, TN</a> and hiring Jack to help run it is the
            perfect answer to a burgeoning roasting business.</p>

        <p>Jack is a big fan of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Wave_Coffee">Third Wave</a> coffee
            movement. Although he doesn't give off the vibe, there is most certainly a little bit of "coffee
            snob" in him. He has been brewing single-origin coffees from many different
            roasters for a number of years. He was a Tonxian for a few iterations and loved every one! Sadly it
            became hard for him to justify the expense to his wife since he shared so much of it with his coworkers.
        </p>

        <p>To this day he continues his routine of making <a href="http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/">Chemex</a> coffee
            and distributing it to his teammates in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demitasse">demitasse</a> cups.</p>

        <h2>Wow, Jack sounds like a cool guy. How can I chat him up?</h2>

        <p class="lead">If you're trying to get in touch, here's how.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-6 pull-left">
        <h4>Electronic mail</h4>

        <p>Jack freely admits he's not the greatest at responding to email, so here are some things you can include
            to make yourself stand out:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your current favorite YouTube video.</li>
            <li>Your favorite 'easy dinner' recipe.</li>
            <li>Your favorite place to get coffee that is <strong>not</strong> the Bux.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you are what some might call the 'recruiter type', you are strongly encouraged to include all three in
            order to brighten up his inbox.
            ;-)</p>

    <div class="col-sm-6 pull-left">
        <h4>Telephone</h4>

        <p>If you already have Jack's telephone number, great! If not, you're somewhat out of luck because he
            doesn't think it's the greatest idea to broadcast his digits. If you were playing Monopoly, imagine you
            drew a card that reads:</p>

        <p>Go directly to 'Electronic mail'. Do not pass GO, do not collect $200.</p>

        <p class="lead">A more detailed view of Jack's technical skill set.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 pull-left">
        <h4>What for?</h4>

        <p>Jack has touched many different technologies and tools throughout his career, and there are many things
            that interest him from a technical perspective. Jack prides himself on being able to pick up new things
            quickly, whether they be programming languages, system architectures, or developer tools. This section seeks to document his skill set
            in relative terms for those interested.</p>

        <p>Bottom line, Jack is a problem solver. Put to the task, he can figure out just about anything.</p>
